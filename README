meta-connectedway
=================

This layer provides metadata that allows integration of Connected Way's
products with the Yocto Project build system.

This layer is qualified against the pyro and hardknott releases of Yocto.

This layer provides:

mbedtls recipe for v3.2.1.  Openfiles depends on v3.2.1 for CCM support.
the default version of mbedtls supported by hardknott is v2.25.0.  Therefore
we provide our own recipe.

openfiles recipe for v5.1.1.  This will build openfiles for a yocto distro.
The following packages can be deployed:
- openfiles: Deploys libof_smb and libof_core shared libraries along with
/etc/openfiles.xml
- openfiles-test: Deploys test binaries on the target.
- openfiles-dev: Deploys files needed to build dependent recipes (smbcp)
- openfiles-staticdev: Deploys static libraries to build dependent
recipes (not currently used)
- openfiles-dbg: Deploys debug sources, binaries, and libraries

cmake recipe for version 3.22.3:  Openfiles depends on cmake version > 3.20.
the default cmake provided by hardknott is 3.19.

smbcp recipe:  This is an example application that utilizes the openfiles
smb v2/v3 client.  It depends on the the openfiles package as well as krb5
and mbedtls.  It is intended that this package will provide an example of
how embedded linux applications can utilize openfiles to access remote
directories using SMBv2/v3.

A script in scripts/runqemu.openfiles which will bring up a qemu VM
with the right parameters.  

There are two branches:
- pyro
- hardknott

If you are checking out a poky branch based on the pyro release (for
example, pyro-20.04 in the connectedway poky fork), you should checkout
the pyro branch of meta-connectedway.  If you are checking out a poky branch
based on the hardknott release (can be direct from git.yoctoproject.org or
from the connectedway fork) you should set the meta-connectedway branch to
hardknott.
